## Description
This game was designed from the impression of food call shabu. "Shabu-Shabu" is a Japanese nabemono hotpot dish of thinly sliced meat and vegetables boiled in water and served with dipping sauces. The term is onomatopoeic, derived from the sound – "swish swish" – emitted when the ingredients are stirred in the cooking pot. The food is cooked piece by piece by the diner at the table. Shabu-shabu is generally more savory and less sweet than sukiyaki, another hot pot dish.
The complexity of this game design is how to make object collide with a trigger. The reason to create this game is in marketing simulator game are most popular and interesting to create but on theme or type are biggest decision on plyerbase who want to invest and food type game is not a best but it have style in own way and also we love to eat so why not.
